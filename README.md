# Master of Magic savegame editor

Yes, this is yet another [MoM](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Master_of_Magic) savegame editor, but since I'm on a linux-based notebook and the other editors are all very old like the game itself, here we go.

## Why?
It's easy: Because I can.  
In 1994 when MoM was first released, it took me around a year to get it into my hands and I even have one copy on floppy disks laying around here (aside fom the GoG one and the new release).  
After re-discovering it a few weeks back and the need to (re)learn some Java skills, fiddling with JavaFX etc., I decided to build this editor.

Basically this is my hommage to this great old game, I so dearly love.

## Editor
I'll fill this section with a few infos on what you can edit and where it's limitations are.  
But, to be honest, [there are enough resources](https://masterofmagic.fandom.com/wiki/Save_Game_Format) on the game itself and [how to cheat](http://pcgamescreens.blogspot.com/2017/12/master-of-magic-hex-editor-codes-and.html) :-)
